About the Dial Plan:
=====================
The dial plan is responsible for instructing the Cisco Unified Communications Manager system about how to route calls. When you configure a dial plan, you define such rules as:

the type of calls that are allowed

the preferred path that the system uses to place a call, as well as alternate paths

how extensions are dialed

how called and calling numbers are presented

Call Admission Control:
===========================
Voice quality can degrade when too many active calls exist on a link and the amount of bandwidth is oversubscribed. 
Call admission control regulates voice quality by limiting the number of calls that can be 
active at the same time on a particular link. Call admission control does not guarantee a 
particular level of audio quality on the link, but it does allow you to regulate the amount 
of bandwidth that active calls on the link consume.

Call admission control operates by rejecting a call for bandwidth and policy reasons. 
When a call is rejected due to call admission control, the phone of the called party does not 
ring, and the caller receives a busy tone. The caller also receives a message on their phone, 
such as “Not enough bandwidth.” If you have enabled automated alternate routing (AAR), 
call admission control automatically diverts calls to alternate public switched telephone 
network (PSTN) routes when WAN bandwidth is not available
